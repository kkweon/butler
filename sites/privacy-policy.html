    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: [Insert Date]</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to [Your Extension Name] ("us", "we", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy notice, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at [Your Contact Email/Link].</p>
    <p>This privacy notice describes how we might use your information if you use our browser extension [Your Extension Name] (the "Extension").</p>
    <p>Please read this privacy notice carefully as it will help you understand what we do with the information that we collect.</p>

    <h2>2. What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
    <p>[Clearly describe what data your extension collects. Be specific. Examples:]</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data you provide to us:</strong> [e.g., search queries, settings preferences]</li>
        <li><strong>Data collected automatically:</strong> [e.g., browsing history (if applicable, be very clear about this and why), tab information, bookmarks information. Specify if it's stored locally or transmitted.]</li>
        <li><strong>Data from Chrome Extension APIs:</strong> [e.g., chrome.tabs, chrome.history, chrome.bookmarks, chrome.storage.sync. Explain what is accessed and why.]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect [Specify data you explicitly DO NOT collect, e.g., personally identifiable information unless voluntarily provided for a specific feature, financial information, etc.].</p>

    <h2>3. How Do We Use Your Information?</h2>
    <p>[Explain the purpose for collecting the data. Examples:]</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide, operate, and maintain our Extension.</li>
        <li>To improve, personalize, and expand our Extension.</li>
        <li>To understand and analyze how you use our Extension.</li>
        <li>To develop new products, services, features, and functionality.</li>
        <li>For data storage and synchronization (e.g., using chrome.storage.sync for user settings).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Will Your Information Be Shared With Anyone?</h2>
    <p>[State clearly if and how data is shared. Examples:]</p>
    <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties, except as described in this Privacy Policy or with your consent.</p>
    <p>[If you do share, specify with whom and why, e.g., analytics providers (anonymized data), cloud storage for sync (user-initiated).]</p>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>

    <h2>5. How Do We Keep Your Information Secure?</h2>
    <p>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
    <p>[Describe measures, e.g., data is stored locally on your device, or if synced, how it's protected during transit and at rest.]</p>
    <p>However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.</p>

    <h2>6. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
    <p>[Explain your data retention policy. Examples:]</p>
    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
    <p>For data stored locally by the Extension (e.g., using `chrome.storage.local`), this data remains on your device until you uninstall the Extension or clear the Extension's data through browser settings.</p>
    <p>For data synced using `chrome.storage.sync`, this data is managed by your Google Account and subject to Google's privacy policies for synced data.</p>

    <h2>7. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>
    <p>[Inform users of their rights, e.g., access, deletion (especially for locally stored data or data you control).]</p>
    <p>You can review, change, or terminate your [mention any accounts or settings] at any time.</p>
    <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at [Your Contact Email].</p>

    <h2>8. Updates to This Notice</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Effective Date" and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
